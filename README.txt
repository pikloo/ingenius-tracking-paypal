This plugin retrieves tracking numbers and carrier data when an order is paid by paypal and then sends this information to WooCommerce Paypal Payments.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to automatically send a tracking to Paypal using the Paypal API and to display the tracking sent on the order administration page in the WooCommerce Paypal Payment metabox.

2 scenarios are possible:

* The contributor adds, modifies (tracking number and/or carrier name) or deletes an Aftership tracking on the order editing page in the administration. This modification is sent to the Paypal API as soon as the order is saved.
* An import of orders including the tracking number and the carrier name processes the modifications concerning the Aftership tracking and sends the additions and/or modifications to the Paypal API.
